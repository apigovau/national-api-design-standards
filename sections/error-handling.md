# Error Handling

## Error Response Payload

For some errors returning the HTTP status code is enough to convey the response. Additional error information can be supplemented in the response body. For example; HTTP 400 Bad request is considered to be too generic for a validation error and more information must be provided in the response body.

Defined here are the attributes of the error object, which may be extended to include additional attributes as required to meet specific business or enterprise requirements.

| Error attributes | Description | Mandatory? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Identifier of the specific error | Optional |
| `detail` | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. | Mandatory |
| `code` | An application-specific error code | Mandatory |
| `source` | An object containing references to the source of the error, optionally including any of the following members:pointer: a JSON Pointer [RFC6901] to the associated entity in the request document [e.g. "/data" for a primary data object, or "/data/attributes/title" for a specific attribute].parameter: a string indicating which URI query parameter caused the error | Optional |
| `source > pointer` | JSON Pointer [RFC6901] to the associated entity in the request document [e.g. "/data" for a primary data object, or "/data/attributes/title" for a specific attribute]. | Optional |
| `source > parameter` | A string indicating which URI query parameter caused the error. | Optional |

The error schema may be _extended_ with optional fields (e.g. 'helpUrl') as required to meet specific business or enterprise requirements.
The returned error objects must be in a collection (array) â€“ see the examples for details.

## Input Validation

There are two types of input validation errors

|Request Validation Issue | HTTP status code|
|------------- | -------------|
|Not well-formed JSON | `400 Bad Request`|
|Contains validation errors that the client can change e.g. missing a mandatory field | `422 Unprocessable Entity`|

## Error Samples

A sample 400 Bad Request error response:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "86032cbe-a804-4c3b-86ce-ec3041e3effc",
      "detail": "Invalid value(s) in request input",
      "code": "19283",
      "source": {
        "parameter": "postcode"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "45786a8f-452e-492f-a779-801b5d0bd0a7",
      "detail": "Input value(s) exceeded maximum length",
      "code": "19284",
      "source": {
        "parameter": "last_name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A sample 500 Internal Service error:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [{
    "id": "86032cbe-a804-4c3b-86ce-ec3041e3effc",
    "detail": "Downstream system is not responding correctly"
    "code" : "500"
  }]
}
```

## Warning and Information Responses

It may be appropriate in some scenarios for resource servers to return information about non-critical errors or other significant conditions.
The necessity of any mechanism intended to convey information about a resource that is not encompassed in the canonical representation of that resource should be carefully considered. When employing extra-data messages, the intent of such messages **MUST** be clearly articulated in API specifications, **MUST NOT** constrain or direct client behaviour (i.e. avoid close coupling) and **MUST NOT** be stateful (i.e. do not represent retention of client state by the server). Warning and information messages **SHOULD** be returned only in exceptional circumstances, **MUST ONLY** be returned by a server and **MUST NOT** be passed to a server by a client.

When utilised. Warning and information messages **MUST** be returned as child objects of a single 'messages' top level collection, and **MAY ONLY** be returned with a success response (Success 200, 201), Bad Request (400) or Unprocessable Entity (422). 

The messages object **MUST** conform to the error object definition described above, and **SHOULD** include an aditional 'severity' attribute.

| Attribute | Description | Mandatory? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `severity` | The severity level of the message. Valid values: 'information' or 'warning'. | Optional |

Sample warning content :

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "applicationId": "65648987234",
    "creationDate": "2020-01-01",
    "applicantId": "123456",
    "status": "incomplete"
  }
  "messages": [
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "id": "86032cbe-a804-4c3b-86ce-ec3041e3effc",
      "code": "APP0025",
      "detail": "application 65648987234 to be retired 2022-01-01 due to inactivity"
    }
  ]
}
```
