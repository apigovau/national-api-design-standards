# Community
Together weâ€˜ll be able to build products and services better, faster and easier.

Join our community today. It's a great chance to

- **learn** about data exchange and APIs from likeminded people in government

- **share** any APIs or machine-to-machine services your agency has developed

- **contribute** to the development of api.gov.au to make it work the way you and your users need

Alternatively, please email api@dta.gov.au with any feedback, suggestions or involvement in upcoming workshops.
